"""Runs a renewal cohort - the task card's own language: 'Batches run for the whole renewal cohort with
genuine exceptions flagged for a human.'

Design commitments, each a direct answer to a question the task brief raises explicitly for batch work:

- Failures are isolated per customer: one customer's crash never stops the batch (try/except inside the
  loop, not around it).
- Operations are bounded: `max_customers` is a hard stopping rule, not a suggestion - a runaway loop
  against a metered API (500 ops/month, verified in Phase 4) is exactly the mistake the task brief warns
  about ("budget your operations... give it a small-sample mode and a stopping rule").
- No automatic retry: a failed customer is reported, not silently retried - retrying against a
  metered, per-operation API multiplies the cost of a real failure instead of surfacing it.
- Progress is reported via a callback, not buried in logs only - a batch UI needs to show it live.
