"""One customer, start to finish: extract terms -> compute true-up -> decide exception -> generate the
amendment through SuperDocs -> (human gate for exceptions only) -> export.

Clean vs. exception is where SuperDocs's two approval modes map directly onto the business rule
(app/true_up.py::determine_exception): a clean renewal's amendment auto-applies (approval_mode=approve_all,
verified in Phase 4 of the design), because there's nothing that needs a second pair of eyes - the entire
point of 'the cohort batch surfaces real exceptions instead of dumping everything into review.' An
exception's amendment pauses for a real human decision (approval_mode=ask_every_time, also verified live),
same mechanism SuperDocs itself uses for HITL.
